This Building Block is a standalone version of the [3D Cadastre Survey Data Model Exchange Encoding](https://icsm-au.github.io/3d-csdm-common/) Parcels component.

It is provided as a straw man for a Parcel module encoding for use in the upcoming LADM encoding, supporting a full topology model extensible to 3D.
